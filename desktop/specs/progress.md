## T0.2 — Agent + MCP spike

Run against Claude Code **2.1.228**, macOS, subscription login, `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` unset
(`env -u`). Throwaway Node MCP servers (stdio and streamable-HTTP) plus a `PreToolUse` hook, all in
a scratch dir outside the repo. Eleven `claude -p` runs, transcripts inspected as raw stream-json.

### The four things the spike had to prove

| # | Claim | Result |
| --- | --- | --- |
| a | Subscription login works with no API key | **Confirmed.** `system/init.apiKeySource == "none"`, run succeeds. |
| b | An app-hosted MCP server loads and is reported | **Confirmed.** `mcp_servers: [{"name":"library","status":"connected"}]`. Both stdio and HTTP transports. |
| c | A trivial tool is called and streams `tool_use` / `tool_result` | **Confirmed**, including a tool that deliberately took 4–5s to resolve. |
| d | `--resume <session_id>` continues the conversation | **Confirmed.** Turn 2 recalled turn 1's tool argument; `session_id` is stable across resumes. |

Design.md §4 survives on all four. Five things it got wrong, in descending severity.

### F1 — `--allowedTools` + `--permission-mode dontAsk` does **not** restrict the agent (breaks D4)

Design §5 asserts "no raw `Bash` … `--permission-mode dontAsk` denies anything outside
`--allowedTools`." False. With `--allowedTools mcp__library__ping --permission-mode dontAsk`, the
agent ran `Bash("echo SPIKE_BASH_RAN")` and got the output. `init.tools` advertised 31 builtins
alongside our two. `--allowedTools` pre-approves; it does not exclude.

Two levers that do work, and we need both:

- **`--disallowedTools <names…>`** removes tools from the advertised set entirely (the agent then
  answers `CANNOT_RUN_BASH`). But it is a **deny-list against a moving target**: denying
  `ToolSearch` revealed `Glob`/`Grep`, which the first run never listed, and any builtin added in a
  future Claude Code release is permitted by default. Not sufficient alone.
- **A `PreToolUse` hook that denies by default** and allows only `mcp__library__*`. Structural and
  version-proof: the hook receives `tool_name` on stdin and returns
  `hookSpecificOutput.permissionDecision: "deny"`. Verified: `Bash` came back as
  `tool_result … is_error: true, "Bash is not on the app whitelist"`, while
  `mcp__library__ping` in the same turn succeeded.
- **`--disallowedTools "*"`** removes *everything*, our MCP tools included (`init.tools == []`), and
  the model then hallucinated a tool list. Not usable.

**Required invocation shape:** hook-based deny-by-default (the enforcement) **plus**
`--disallowedTools ToolSearch` (so our MCP tools are advertised directly rather than reached
through a tool the hook has to deny) plus `--allowedTools mcp__library__*` (so allowed calls don't
prompt). D11 needs rewriting: the whitelist is enforced by the hook, and `--allowedTools` is only
the no-prompt half.

### F2 — `mcp_server_errors` is `null` even when the server fails to load (breaks the T6.3 gate)

With the server killed, `system/init` reported `mcp_servers: [{"name":"library","status":"failed"}]`
and `mcp_server_errors: null`, and `init.tools` contained no `mcp__` entries. The run then
succeeded with the agent **hallucinating** "pong" for a tool it never called.

Design §4.3's fail-fast condition ("non-empty `mcp_server_errors`") would therefore never fire, in
the one situation it exists for. The gate must be: every expected server present with
`status == "connected"` **and** every expected `mcp__library__*` tool present in `init.tools`.
`mcp_server_errors` is at best a secondary signal.

### F3 — A stdio MCP server is a fresh child process per turn, spawned twice

`server.log` recorded **two** distinct pids per `claude` invocation (13 starts across 7 runs), all
children of the `claude` process, all exiting with it. Consequences:

- A stdio server **cannot be** the Tauri app and cannot hold walkthrough state. Design §7's
  `request_secret` flow (suspend the tool, render a Vue field, resolve after submit) needs the tool
  handler to live in the process that owns the UI. Over stdio it would need a second IPC hop back
  into the app.
- `initialize` must be side-effect free, since it runs twice per turn.

**Streamable HTTP works and removes the problem.** A `{"type":"http","url":"http://127.0.0.1:<port>/mcp",
"headers":{"Authorization":"Bearer …"}}` entry connected cleanly, and the tool result carried the
server's pid, confirming one long-lived in-process host across every turn. A tool that blocked for
5s resolved normally. This is the transport Phase 7 should use: loopback bind, per-session bearer
token, no second process.

### F4 — `"received"` reads as an empty result to the model (refines T7.2)

With `request_secret` resolving to the literal `"received"`, the agent reported *"The tool returned
an empty/no result"* and offered to retry. The fixed acknowledgement still must not echo the value,
but it has to be unambiguous, e.g. `SECRET_RECEIVED: the user submitted ATLASSIAN_API_TOKEN via the
app's secure field. Do not ask for it. Continue with run_skill_setup.`

Related: a cold prompt asking to collect a credential got **refused** on safety grounds. The
walkthrough prompt must carry the setup context (skill, why the credential is needed) or turn 1
stalls.

### F5 — The stream carries event types design §4.3 doesn't list

Observed across the runs: `system/hook_started`, `system/hook_response`, `system/thinking_tokens`,
and a top-level `rate_limit_event`. **`system/api_retry` never appeared**; `rate_limit_event` seems
to be its current form. Unknown `type` and unknown `system.subtype` must both be ignored rather
than treated as errors, on the same "tolerate growth" reasoning as T1.5's unknown JSON keys.

Also worth knowing for T6.1: `--strict-mcp-config` exists and works, loading only our config. It
recovers most of what D10 gave up by dropping `--bare` (the teammate's personal MCP servers stay
out), while OAuth/subscription auth keeps working. Their hooks and `CLAUDE.md` still load.

### Verdict

Phase 1 is unblocked. Design.md needs edits to §4.1, §4.3, §5, §7 and requirements D11 before
Phase 6/7 are implemented; F1 and F2 are the two that make the current text unsafe if followed
literally.
